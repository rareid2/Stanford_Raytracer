    Search between ``start_time`` and ``end_time``, which should both be
    :class:`~skyfield.timelib.Time` objects, for the occasions where the
    function ``f`` changes from one value to another.  Use this to
    search for events like sunrise or moon phases.

    A tuple of two arrays is returned. The first array gives the times
    at which the input function changes, and the second array specifies
    the new value of the function at each corresponding time.

    This is an expensive operation as it needs to repeatedly call the
    function to narrow down the times that it changes.  It continues
    searching until it knows each time to at least an accuracy of
    ``epsilon`` Julian days.  At each step, it creates an array of
    ``num`` new points between the lower and upper bound that it has
    established for each transition.  These two values can be changed to
    tune the behavior of the search.
