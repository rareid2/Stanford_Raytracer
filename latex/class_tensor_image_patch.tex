Patch extraction specialized for image processing. This assumes that the input has a least 3 dimensions ordered as follow\+: 1st dimension\+: channels (of size d) 2nd dimension\+: rows (of size r) 3rd dimension\+: columns (of size c) There can be additional dimensions such as time (for video) or batch (for bulk processing after the first 3. Calling the image patch code with patch\+\_\+rows and patch\+\_\+cols is equivalent to calling the regular patch extraction code with parameters d, patch\+\_\+rows, patch\+\_\+cols, and 1 for all the additional dimensions.
