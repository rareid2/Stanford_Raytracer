This is the A\+PI documentation for Eigen3. You can \href{eigen-doc.tgz}{\texttt{ download}} it as a tgz archive for offline reading.

You\textquotesingle{}re already an Eigen2 user? Here is a \mbox{\hyperlink{_eigen2_to_eigen3}{Eigen2 to Eigen3 guide }} to help porting your application.

For a first contact with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}}, the best place is to have a look at the \mbox{\hyperlink{_getting_started}{getting started }} page that show you how to write and compile your first program with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}}.

Then, the {\bfseries{quick}} {\bfseries{reference}} {\bfseries{pages}} give you a quite complete description of the A\+PI in a very condensed format that is specially useful to recall the syntax of a particular feature, or to have a quick look at the A\+PI. They currently cover the two following feature sets, and more will come in the future\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{group___quick_ref_page}{\mbox{[}Quick\+Ref\mbox{]} Dense matrix and array manipulations }}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{group___sparse_quick_ref_page}{\mbox{[}Quick\+Ref\mbox{]} Sparse linear algebra }}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You\textquotesingle{}re a Mat\+Lab user? There is also a \href{AsciiQuickReference.txt}{\texttt{ short A\+S\+C\+II reference}} with Matlab translations.

The {\bfseries{main}} {\bfseries{documentation}} is organized into {\itshape chapters} covering different domains of features. They are themselves composed of {\itshape user} {\itshape manual} pages describing the different features in a comprehensive way, and {\itshape reference} pages that gives you access to the A\+PI documentation through the related \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}}\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape modules} and {\itshape classes}.

Under the \mbox{\hyperlink{UserManual_CustomizingEigen}{Extending/\+Customizing Eigen}} section, you will find discussions and examples on extending Eigen\textquotesingle{}s features and supporting custom scalar types.

Under the \mbox{\hyperlink{UserManual_Generalities}{General topics}} section, you will find documentation on more general topics such as preprocessor directives, controlling assertions, multi-\/threading, M\+KL support, some \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}}\textquotesingle{}s internal insights, and much more...

Finally, do not miss the search engine, useful to quickly get to the documentation of a given class or function.
